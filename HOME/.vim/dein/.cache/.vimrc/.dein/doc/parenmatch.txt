INTRODUCTION					*parenmatch-introduction*

This *parenmatch* plugin highlights the matching parenthesis based on the
value of |matchpairs|. This plugin is an alternative of the standard |matchparen|
plugin. This plugin is about 8 times faster than the |matchparen| plugin.

This plugin is enabled by default. But if you keep |matchparen| running, it is
not efficient. In order to disable the standard |matchparen| plugin, add the
following configuration to your vimrc file. >

	let g:loaded_matchparen = 1
<
Why is this |parenmatch| plugin such faster than the standard plugin? I took
profiles again and again, and I found some inefficient codes in the standard
|matchparen| plugin.

	1. Skipping the parenthesis matching based on the syntax names. It
	   uses the {skip} argument of |searchpairpos| and deals the
	   parenthesis matching very correctly. This is actually an intended
	   usage of this function as the example in the |match-parens| section
	   shows. However, obtaining the sytnax under the cursor is basically
	   an inefficient operation. This part of codes (the line of evaluating
	   s_skip and searchpairpos) is the heaviest part of |matchparen|.

	2. Obtaining the character under the cursor using a regular expression
	   |/\%c|.

	3. Splitting the value of |matchpairs| by a regular expression every
	   time the cursor moves. The value of this option does not change so
	   much. At least, it does not change while moving the cursor around.

So, how does |parenmatch| overcome these problems?

	1. It does not support strict matching of the parenthesis. Stop
	   checking the syntax, the |parenmatch| cannot deal with the following
	   code correctly. >
	       [ [ "[  ]  [" ], [ "]  [  ]" ] ]
<	   However, the plugin actually works in most pieces of code. If you
	   still want it work with the code like above, you can use the
	   standard plugin.

	2. It uses the string indexing to obtain the character under the
	   cursor. It does the same thing and is much faster.

	3. It splits the value of |matchpairs| in advance. The cache is updated
	   when the option is set (using |OptionSet|) or the active window is
	   changed.

The code of |parenmatch| is actually very small. The updating function is only
about 10 lines. When the character under the cursor is not a parenthesis
character, the function finishes after executing only 4 lines. I think the
implimentation is optimal but if you find further performance improvement,
please submit a pull request (https://github.com/itchyny/vim-parenmatch/pulls).

OPTIONS						*parenmatch-options*

	g:parenmatch				*g:parenmatch*
		Set this variable to 0 to disable this plugin globally.

	b:parenmatch				*b:parenmatch*
		If you set this variable to 0, the plugin stops highlighting
		the parenthesis under the cursor in the buffer. This variable
		has priority over |g:parenmatch|.
